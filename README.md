# OMS
I created order management system for a company that produces advertising materials.\
The basis of the program is **creating orders** and monitoring their status.\
The system **improves communication** between the sales, graphics and production departments.\
It **verifies the entered data** and reduces the number of activities required for order processing.\
I used Python, Django, PostgreSQL and JavaScript.\
